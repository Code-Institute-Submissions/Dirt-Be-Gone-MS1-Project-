### **1.5 Design choices** 

* I wanted the website to have a bright and clean feel to it. Its for a cleaning company so i decided on bright clean colours. I didn't want lots of clutter on the pages as this can be common with websites for this type of business. I also wanted the site to be easy to navigate.

#### FONTS

* I decided i would use the Google fonts Raleway & Lato for this project. I chose these two fonts as modern, clean, easy to read and look well on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### ICONS

* I also decided i would use font awesome icons throughout the site. I did this because i believe icons make a site look better and also give the user an idea of the type of information that they are looking at.

* I also used font awesome for the companies social media icons (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn) located in the footer of the page. 

#### COLOURS

* I did some research as to what colours would be best to use for a cleaning company. A lot of the information i found from my web searches said that bright colours work well as they convey a bright/clean feel to them. Also white is the colour that is most associated with cleanliness, clean white sheets for example, so i wanted to incorporate white into the site as if it were a blank white canvas. 
<br>

* The text is written in black as this is the colour that contrasts the best with a white background. 
<br>

* For my hyperlinks i wanted to use the standard blue that people are familiar with when browsing a website.
<br>

* Finally on the FAQ page i decided to use a light grey background for the question, and a white background for the answer. I initially went for an white background on both but i found that it was hard on the eyes to differentiate between the question and the answer, so i went with a grey background. 
<br>

* The main colour pallet can be found below.

<br>

* I used the website colour mind when deciding on which colours to use. The website uses a generator to help you select the best matching colour palettes for your project. The website can be found here:<br>

### **1.6 Wire frames**

## **2. Features**

### **2.1 The Navbar**

* The Navbar i decided to use a standard Bootstrap 4.4 Navbar with brand. I did this because i wanted the company logo in the top left, and the menu items on the right. The menu items i decided on were 

1. Home
2. About Us
3. Cleaning Services 
4. Our Promise 
5. FAQ
6. Contact us

The site also needs to be mobile responsive so i chose Bootstrap as it provided me with a quick and easy way of achieving this.

### **2.2 The Footer** 

* In the footer i have listed all of the companies contact details and also put all of the companies social media links. The navbar and the footer are identical on each page as to maintain cohesion no matter what page the user finds themselves on. 

### **2.3 The Hero image**

* I wanted to use some great images here, so i have used a bootstrap carousel to show several images of different property interiors that are very clean to show the standard the cleaners work to. 

### **2.4 Testimonials**

* I have also used another bootstrap carousel below the hero images for customer reviews and testimonials.

### **2.5 About Us Page**

* Allows any user to read more information on the company, when the were set up, why they were set up, and what their mission statement is

### **2.6 Cleaning Services Page**

* On this page users can browse all of the services offered by the company. There is also some additional information on pricing. Users can also click on the service they are interested in purchasing and then be directed to the contact us form so they can supply contact details and any additional information about the job they need doing 

### **2.7 Our Promise Page**

* Before purchasing a service from the company potential customers can read this section and know what kind of level of service they can expect and the standards the company promise to achieve.

### **2.8 FAQ Page**

* Lots of customers will always have a few questions about a product or service before they buy it. By adding this section to the website it allows us the potential customer to see if their question is here, and if so, to have it answered. This means the customer doesn't have to call the office number so it will save staff time answering the same kind of questions over and over again. 

### **2.9 Contact Us Page**

* Users can use this section to message the company and select which specific service they are interested in using. The companies office address is also displayed via a Google map. 

### **2.10 Features Left To Implement**

1. An online booking engine where customers can select the type of service they wish to use, and select the date and time they wish that service to start. 
2. An online payment option so people can make payment for the service they wish to purchase 
3. An invoicing system where the company can email invoices to customers that contains a payment link so they can pay online after the job is completed and payment is due. 
4. A customer account and log in where customers can review all of their account details such as the name on their account, their current address, past services purchases, and any current services running (Example: weekly cleaning service)

## **4. Testing**

### **The NavBar**

Created a Navbar using Bootstrap. I did this because it will allow the site to work on mobile, iPad and desktop and it will easier to set when these points come into play.

* The company logo will be displayed on the left, and the menu items will be populated on the right. 
* I have decided that the NavBar menu will collapse from a list into the dropdown hamburger menu from md screen size and below.
* When i created the navbar the menu items were appearing on the left right next to the main logo, i don't like this look, i pushed them to the right by inserting ml-auto into the following line of code:

`<div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">`

`<ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto">`

* When the hamburger menu is created and you click on it, the menu items appear on the left hand side, underneath the logo, this doesn't look good so i want them to populated below the hamburger menu itself. To solve this i used developer tools in chrome and highlighted the item im trying to change, its showing as a.nav-link - In my code i have inserted into the li class "ml-auto" (Code below)

`<li class="nav-item active ml-auto">`

This now pushes the items over to the right under the hamburger menu where i wanted it to go. I will do this for every li item in my menu so they all populate on the right.

* I also want the NavBar to stick to the top of the page when people are scrolling up and down the page, this will allow them to navigate easily. To do this i have used the code sticky-top (Code Below) 

`<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg sticky-top navbar-light">`

### **The Footer**

Again i have decided to use bootstrap for my footer. I have done this because i want my footer, like the nav bar, to react differently on different screen sizes. I have broken my footer down into 3 columns, left, centre, right.

The aim of the website if to provide any potential customer with: 

* The background of the company and their mission statement 
* The services the company offers along with a guide price for these services 
* To allow potential customers to select a specific service and to contact the company directly and request the use of a service 

On the website people can browse the services offered along with their prices, read testimonials from current and past customers, browse our FAQ section, read the companies mission statement, and also make a request for more information if they wish to use the companies service. 

I myself have owned an Airbnb property rentals business in Dublin for the last 5 years and have always found cleaning companies offer very poor websites for their services.
