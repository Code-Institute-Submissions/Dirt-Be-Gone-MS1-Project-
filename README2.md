# **DIRT BE GONE - RESIDENTIAL CLEANING AND HANDYMAN SERVICES**

The Dirt Be Gone website was built to provide people who live in the Dublin area easy online access to a range of residential cleaning and handyman services offered by the Dirt Be Gone company. 

## **UX**

This website is for anyone who owns, manages, or rents a residential property in the Dublin area that needs the use of a cleaner, housekeeper or handyman. 

I myself have owned an Airbnb property rentals business in Dublin for the last 5 years and have always found cleaning companies offer very poor websites for their services.

### **THE USER STORIES WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS:**

## **TESTING**

### **The NavBar**

Created a Navbar using Bootstrap. I did this because it will allow the site to work on mobile, iPad and desktop and it will easier to set when these points come into play.

* The company logo will be displayed on the left, and the menu items will be populated on the right. 
* I have decided that the NavBar menu will collapse from a list into the dropdown hamburger menu from md screen size and below.
* When i created the navbar the menu items were appearing on the left right next to the main logo, i don't like this look, i pushed them to the right by inserting ml-auto into the following line of code 
<div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
    <ul class="navbar-nav ml-auto">
